// [08/13/13] Challenge #136 [Easy] Student Management
// (Easy): Student Management
// You are a computer science professor at South Harmon Institute of Technology, and are in dire need of automatic grading! The good news is you have all of your student's assignments in an easy-to-read format, making automation easy!

// You will be given a list of unique student names, and then a list of their assignment grades. All assignments are based on 20 points and are scored in whole-numbers (integers). All students have received the same number of assignments, so you don't have to worry about managing jagged arrays.

// Author: nint22

// Formal Inputs & Outputs
// Input Description
// On standard console input, you will be given two space-delimited integers N and M: N is the number of students (which ranges from 1 to 60, inclusive), and M is the number of assignments (which ranges from 4 to 100, inclusive). This will be followed by N lines of text, each starting with an upper-case unique string being is your students name. This is then followed by M integers, which are the grades ranging from 0 to 20, inclusively.

// Output Description
// On the first line of output, print the class' average grade. Then, for each student, print their name and average grade (up to two decimal points precision).

// Sample Inputs & Outputs
// Sample Input 1
// 3 5
// JON 19 14 15 15 16
// JEREMY 15 11 10 15 16

// Solution
const studentGrade = (arr: string[]): number => {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    sum += Number(arr[i]);
  }
  return parseFloat((sum / (arr.length - 1)).toFixed(2));
};

const calculateAve = (studentInfo: string[]): object => {
  let returnObj: { [key: string]: number } = {};

  for (let i = 0; i < studentInfo.length; i++) {
    const student = studentInfo[i].split(' ');
    let name = student[0];
    returnObj[name] = studentGrade(student);
  }
  return returnObj;
};

console.log(calculateAve(['JON 19 14 15 15 16']));
